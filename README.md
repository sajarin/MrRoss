A python web scraper that finds business leads from the [NY Chamber of Commerce directory](https://www.chamber.nyc/directory.asp")

### Testing 
This scraper uses BeautifulSoup v4 and Python 3.5, make sure these are installed on your machine in order to use this script 

#### Note 
NY Chamber of Commerce directory changed the layout of their website and the architecture of their database and so the script no longer functions as it should.

The script needs to be updated and revamped to be utilized properly.
